# Shopping Cart Application with React & Chakra UI

A simple e-commerce shopping cart application built with **React** and **Chakra UI**.

## What I Built

- **Product Listing**: Display all products in a grid layout on the homepage
- **Product Details**: View detailed information about individual products
- **Shopping Cart**: Add and remove products from the cart
- **Cart Drawer**: Slide-out cart panel to view selected items
- **Checkout Page**: Simple checkout page to review cart items
- **Toast Notifications**: Show user feedback for actions like adding items to cart
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices

## How It Works

- **Context API**: Used for managing cart state and notifications across the app
- **Chakra UI Components**: Built the entire UI using Chakra UI components for consistent styling
- **Component Structure**: Organized reusable components for headers, product cards, and cart management
